This extension will highlight any company and/or names that is associated with a 500 startups company.

Why? 
We were fundraising for our company for a seed round and wanted to get intros from investors that also have invested in previous 500.co companies.

New in V2:

- Since version 2 we have added the ability to also highlight the investors and angels who also have invested in the 500 family. Turn it on by going to chrome://extensions/ and the clicking on the Options link.

Demo: 

- Install the plugin.
- Goto https://angel.co/forerunner-ventures
- You should see the 500 companies that this VC firm invested in.
